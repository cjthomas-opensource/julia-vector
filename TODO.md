# Abbreviated bug list and task list:

* 29 Jan 2023 --
Setting "connected" to -1+0.4i with 10 iterations gives disconnection lines.
The algorithm for fixing discontinuities isn't catching these.

* 29 Jan 2023 --
Feature request: Have command-line arguments to adjust image size and line
thickness. We're fine for CAD import without these but the lines are too
thick when upscaling high-iteration-count plots.
